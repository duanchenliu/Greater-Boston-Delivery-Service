## What
A grocery shopping and delivery project, served 1300+ individuals around the greater Boston area and delievered products with a total worth of over $100k in 5 months. 
## When
During the 2020 Covid quarantine period.
## Where
Greater Boston area.
## Why
The main goal was to help people in my community who cannot go out and buy daily groceries during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
## How
We were a diverse team of 5 passionate Lexington residents who wanted to serve the community during the difficult time. The idea first came when we realized that a lot of people (especially elders) in our community don't feel comfortable going to the grocery stores during the pademic and online delivery services (e.g. Amazon Fresh, Instacart...) are all fully booked for weeks. So we decided to take the initiative to build out a grocery delivery service for the community. 

We partnered with RestaurantDepot warehouses and several local shops for products, negotiated prices, built website for product ordering and invoicing, picked up and delivered products to customers, and conducted analysis on the orders to optimize delivery routes.

After out initial project roll out in Lexington, we received a lot of positive feedback and our customers passed our names along to their friends and families around the Greater Boston area. That's when we decided to expand the service to more communities. 

* Team structure: 1 web developer, 2 delivery staff, 1 logistic coordinator, 1 marketing and business coordinator.
